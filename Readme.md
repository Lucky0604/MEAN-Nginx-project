# Using Nginx handle the static files in MEAN project

This is my first tutorial for the Node beginners like me.

Normally, we build the MEAN or any others Node project in one folder. 
Let the node server hold all request. 
If your project is not as bigger as it is. That's Ok.
But if your project changed bigger, or some others wanna join the project.
What makes your project easier to face these problem?

### Make the structure particular!

In this Tutorial(actrually, it's my note), I'll try to explain how to separat the back-end and the front-end.

### using the nginx to handle the static files(html, js, css, img, less...)
### using the node to support the RESTFUL Api
